This a small app, a small TicTacToe game, created during a bootcamp session in which we have reiterated Android and Kotlin fundamentals.
The app is based on:
** Kotlin
** Android App Architecture based on MVVM
** LiveData for UI links and RxJava for the game logic - was mandatory
** XML / Compose was optional
GameLogic is separately out of the ViewModels
